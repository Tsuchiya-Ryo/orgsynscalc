Put numbers at g/mol(molwt) and mg or mmol of "reagent_A" first,\
then reagent_B and the others will be calculated.

Exponent\
  6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> → type 6.02e23\
  6.63 x 10<sup>-34</sup> → type 6.63e-34
 

Options for Reagent_A

Switch\
  mg → mmol: when you have x mg, xx % purity compound and want to know it's mole(mmol)\
  mmol → mg: when you have xx % purity compound and want to know the amount(mg) to get x mmol

Molar and Mass Concentration\
  calculates required solvent volume from given concentration and vice versa
